# TabSec
Project for DL Workshop, at TAU University under prof. Nadav Cohen.

In the project we test 2 approaches for defense against adversarial attacks on tabular data: Finetuning on adv. examples and SVM Boosintg.

To run the project, download all the python code, and execute main.py.
Note: it will take a long time (for Tabnet it took us around 4 hours to run all the test.)

If you want faster results, you can lower the n_train_data parameter in main.py. It affects how many adversarial examples the code
will produce for training.
